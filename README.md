# Robotic Arm Simulator
---
This MATLAB script I created allows the user to simulate (in two dimensions) a robotic arm with n segments of lengths l. The resultant orientaion of the arm - given the specified segment lengths and servo values - is displayed. Every possible end effector location is also marked in the image, resulting in an effective work envelope. The x and y coordinates of every end effector location are stored along with their corresponding servo values. This allows the user to avoid the tedious process of calculating the inverse kinematics or the long process of trial and error required to find the servo values for required to yield a desired end effector location and orientaion.
