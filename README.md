# Robotic Arm Simulator
---
This MATLAB script I created allows the user to simulate a robotic arm  in two dimensions with n segments of lengths l. The resultant orientaion of the arm - given the specified segment lengths and servo values - is displayed. Every possible end effector location is also marked in the image, resulting in an effective work envelope. The x and y coordinates of every end effector location are stored along with their corresponding servo values. This allows the user to avoid the tedious process of calculating the inverse kinematics by hand or the long process of trial and error required to find the servo values required to yield a desired end effector location and orientaion. I intend to add support for three dimensional simulation at some point in the future.
